# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
Gathered a lot of helpful information and insights from this data in order to put it all together and share our findings with Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It took me some time to figure out how to list all the months on the row labels.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I encountered some issues when I kept getting #DIV/0! for some cells, but then I realized I should put **Iferrorr** formula instead.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There are two reasons why creating charts and pivot table can be helpful:

1.data can be easily interpreted and more readible.

2.allow audience to see the meaning behind the numbers, and they make showing comparisons and trends much easier.

However, chart suggestion doesn't always provide you the best chart. I need to change the chart type myself several times.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- May hit the highest amount of being sucessful based on the chart.
- There is no cancellation in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- The percentage of cancellation is 0 for all the goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- This dataset can be lack of reliability because we don't know where the origin source is from.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- maybe we could create more graphs based on descriptive statistics sheet to see the differences among each type of graphs.
